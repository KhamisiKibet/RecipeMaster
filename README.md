  - `App.xaml` & `App.xaml.cs`: Application entry point and setup.
  - `AppShell.xaml` & `AppShell.xaml.cs`: Navigation and shell configuration.

## UI/UX Design

- A side drawer menu for accessing different sections of the app, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- Theme settings that allow users to switch between dark and light modes to suit their preferences.

## MVC Implementations

RecipeMaster uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, a core aspect of the MVC design architecture:

- **Model**: 
  - Represents the data layer of the app.
  - Defined in the `Models` directory, which includes classes such as `Recipe.cs`, `Category.cs`, and `Tag.cs`.

- **View**:
  - Represents the UI layer of the app.
  - Defined in the `Views` directory, which contains XAML files for each screen (e.g., `HomePage.xaml`, `RecipeDetailPage.xaml`, etc.).

- **ViewModel**:
  - Acts as a bridge between the Model and View, handling the business logic.
  - Defined in the `ViewModels` directory, with view models corresponding to each View (e.g., `HomeViewModel.cs`, `RecipeDetailViewModel.cs`).
